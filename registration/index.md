Registration for ESMARConf2025 is being handled through Open Collective, our fiscal host. Registration is entirely free, but if you want to support our work (including providing bursaries and enhancing accessibility), you can donate a voluntary registration payment on registration. You will receive a receipt that you can then use to claim back from a work account, or alternatively pay directly with a work credit card. You can choose your donation sum by selecting a different value ticket. Free tickets are always available.

Use the form below to register for ESMARConf2025:
