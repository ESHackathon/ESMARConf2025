Shreya Dimri is a 4th-year PhD student in the Department of Evolutionary Biology at Bielefeld University, Germany. Her current research focuses on conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses to better understand individual variation in traits within and between species, and across generations. She is a strong advocate of open science practices and deeply interested in exploring how and why we do science the way we do. She finds great joy in learning new methodologies and writing code (mostly in R).
