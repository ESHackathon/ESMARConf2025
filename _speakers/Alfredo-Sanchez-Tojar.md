Alfredo Sánchez-Tójar is an evolutionary ecologist whose research combines evidence synthesis—primarily meta-analyses—and meta-research, with a touch of empirical studies. He is particularly interested in understanding individual differences and how they shape ecological and evolutionary patterns. He also uses meta-research to identify ways to improve the rigour and efficiency of scientific practice. He has a soft spot for birds and a strong commitment to Open, Reliable, and Transparent science. He serves on the Board of Directors of SORTEE, where we work to enhance reliability and transparency in science through cultural and institutional changes.
