Antica is a senior scientist at the Ruder Boskovic Institute (Zagreb, Croatia) and honorary fellow at NIOO-KNAW (Netherlands).

Her expertise covers evolutionary ecology of bonding, life-history trade offs, evidence synthesis, and data and code standards. She strives to apply my knowledge of different modelling approaches and Open Science to study and optimize scientific process itself - called meta-science and to enable ecological research to reach its full potential.
