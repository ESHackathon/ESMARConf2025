The Evidence Synthesis & Meta-Analysis in R Conference (#ESMARConf) is an annual conference that takes place entirely online. The core focus is in developing and validating tools to support evidence synthesis and meta-analysis in R. ESMARConf is run by the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon and led by an Organising Team consisting of Ryan Field, Rafael Jos√© Vieira, Neal Haddaway and Matthew Grainger.

It features themed sessions of presentations and panel discussions, interactive workshops, and hackathons and codejams.

#ESMARConf2025 will be held online from June 11th - 13th 2025. We promise another exciting programme of content that addresses the following:

Presentations of packages designed to assist reviewers across evidence synthesis stages, from planning to communication
Demonstrations integrating evidence synthesis packages into an interoperable pipeline in R
Novel applications of R packages in an evidence synthesis context
Automating evidence synthesis in R
Assisting novices to R in performing evidence syntheses with the aid of graphical user interfaces
