In this 2-h workshop/hackathon, participants will contribute to a meta-research project investigating the hypothesis that many meta-analyses in ecology and evolution overlook the need to adjust effect size directions across included studies. If true, this would suggest that a substantial number of published meta-analytic estimates may be unreliable.


The project also aims to examine how frequently and in what ways inferential statistics are transformed into effect sizes within these disciplines. Participants will be assigned a selection of published meta-analyses and guided through the process of extracting key indicators related to these questions.


The outcome of this session will serve as a springboard for a broader meta-research initiative that seeks not only to estimate the prevalence of these issues but also to assess their potential consequences. Participants should have some prior experience conducting meta-analyses, particularly in data extraction.


Activities:

- Data/meta-data extraction
- Data wrangling/curation
- Quantitative analysis/synthesis (including meta-analysis)
