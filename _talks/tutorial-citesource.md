CiteSource is an R package and Shiny application designed to support the development of data-driven search strategies. CiteSource provides users the ability to assign custom metadata to citation records that is maintained during deduplication. CiteSource provides a number of built-in visualizations, including plots and tables, to assist users in analyzing record overlap. CiteSource has several practical use cases, such as optimizing source selection, analyzing the effectiveness of search strings, and evaluating the impact of sources and methods. This tutorial will focus on one or two primary use cases and discuss how the package can enhance decision-making during search strategy development as well as how CiteSource can enhance reporting and guide more informed practices in future projects.
