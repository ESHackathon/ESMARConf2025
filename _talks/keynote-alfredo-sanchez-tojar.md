This talk explores both the strengths and limitations of meta-analyses, with a focus on studies in ecology and evolutionary biology. It begins by highlighting the essential role meta-analyses play in hypothesis testing in ecology and evolution,and policy-making. From there, it examines common critiques meta-analysts direct at primary studies, such as poor reporting, lack of data and code sharing, and limited transparency.

The central argument is that meta-analyses themselves often suffer from similar—or even more serious—problems, including low reproducibility, failure to account for heterogeneity among effect sizes, inadequate handling of publication bias, and a widespread lack of risk of bias assessments. These issues can substantially undermine the validity of evidence syntheses.
Throughout the talk, there will be practical recommendations for improving the transparency, rigour, and impact of meta-analyses in ecology and evolution.

While this talk has a focus on studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, the underlying methodology and concepts will be applicable to many disciplines.
