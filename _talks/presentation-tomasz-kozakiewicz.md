Static, text-based research outputs are increasingly being replaced with interactive, web-based applications. Decision-makers request shorter reports and more customisable visualisations. Little guidance exists to help evidence synthesis professionals, such as myself, to determine which reporting shortcuts are permissible, as opposed to those that would compromise research integrity principles. Hence, under the guidance of Dr Fiona Campbell, I am starting a PhD journey to explore the needs of producers and users of interactive evidence dashboards, develop consensus among experts (using a Delphi study) and publish appropriate guidance. I hope that presenting my project at ESMAR will enable me to get early feedback on my methodology and possibly recruit some experts to join my advisory group.
